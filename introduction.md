# Introduction

## The Buddha's Dispensation

> On one occasion, the Blessed One was dwelling among Vajjians at Koṭigāma.
> There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus[^10] thus:[^11]
>
> It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding (an·anubodhā) and not
> penetrating (a·ppaṭivedhā) the Four Noble Truths (Catunnaṁ Ariya·Saccānaṁ)
> that you and I have for a long time wandered the round of rebirth. What four?
>
> 1. It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and not penetrating the Noble
>    Truth of Suffering (Dukkhassa Ariya·Saccassa) that you and I have for a
>    long time wandered the round of rebirth.
> 2. It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and not penetrating the Noble
>    Truth of the Origin of Suffering (Dukkha·Samudayassa Ariya·Saccassa) that
>    you and I have for a long time wandered the round of rebirth.
> 3. It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and not penetrating the Noble
>    Truth of the Cessation of Suffering (Dukkha·Nirodhassa Ariya·Saccassa) that
>    you and I have for a long time wandered the round of rebirth.
> 4. It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and not penetrating the Noble
>    Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering
>    (Duk-kha·Nirodha·Gāminiya Paṭipadāya Ariya·Saccassa) that you and I have
>    for a long time wandered the round of rebirth.

The Four Noble Truths are thus the foundations of The Buddha’s Teaching, His
Dispensation. He then explains:

> 1. The Noble Truth of Suffering, bhikkhus, has been understood and penetrated.
> 2. The Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering has been understood and
>    pentrated.
> 3. The Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering has been understood and
>    penetrated.
> 4. The Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering has been
>    understood and penetrated. Craving for existence has been cut off; the
>    tendency to existence has been destroyed; now there is no more renewed
>    existence.

Let us then see how the Four Noble Truths are related to each other. The Buddha
taught the Four Noble Truths for us to realize the Third Noble Truth, Nibbāna,
which is to put a complete end to rebirth and therefore suffering. But that is
not possible without the right conditions. In the ‘Kūṭāgāra’ sutta (‘The
Peaked-House Sutta’), The Buddha explains first the conditions that make it
impossible to put a complete end to suffering:[^12]

> Indeed, bhikkhus, if anyone said: ‘Without having built the lower structure of
> a peaked house, I shall erect the upper structure’, such a thing is
> impossible. So too, if anyone said:
>
> 1. ‘Without penetrating the Noble Truth of Suffering as it really is;
> 1. ‘without penetrating the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering as it
>    really is;
> 1. ‘without penetrating the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering as it
>    really is;
> 1. ‘without penetrating the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation
>    of Suffering as it really is, ‘I shall put a complete end to suffering’,
>    such a thing is impossible.
