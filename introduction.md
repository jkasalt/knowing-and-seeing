## The Buddha's dispensation.

> On one occasion, the Blessed One was dwelling among Vajjians at Koṭigāma.
> There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus[^10] thus:[^11]
>
> It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding (_an·anubodhā_) and not
> penetrating (_a·ppaṭivedhā_) the Four Noble Truths (_Catunnaṁ Ariya·Saccānaṁ_)
> that you and I have for a long time wandered the round of rebirth. What four?
>
> 1. It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and not penetrating the Noble
>    Truth of Suffering (_Dukkhassa Ariya·Saccassa_) that you and I have for a
>    long time wandered the round of rebirth.
> 2. It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and not penetrating the Noble
>    Truth of the Origin of Suffering (_Dukkha·Samudayassa Ariya·Saccassa_) that
>    you and I have for a long time wandered the round of rebirth.
> 3. It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and not penetrating the Noble
>    Truth of the Cessation of Suffering (_Dukkha·Nirodhassa Ariya·Saccassa_)
>    that you and I have for a long time wandered the round of rebirth.
> 4. It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and not penetrating the Noble
>    Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering
>    (_Duk-kha·Nirodha·Gāminiya Paṭipadāya Ariya·Saccassa_) that you and I have
>    for a long time wandered the round of rebirth.

The Four Noble Truths are thus the foundations of The Buddha’s Teaching, His
Dispensation. He then explains:

> 1. The Noble Truth of Suffering, bhikkhus, has been understood and penetrated.
> 2. The Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering has been understood and
>    pentrated.
> 3. The Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering has been understood and
>    penetrated.
> 4. The Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering has been
>    understood and penetrated. Craving for existence has been cut off; the
>    tendency to existence has been destroyed; now there is no more renewed
>    existence.

## What needs to be fully realized

Let us then see how the Four Noble Truths are related to each other. The Buddha
taught the Four Noble Truths for us to realize the Third Noble Truth, Nibbāna,
which is to put a complete end to rebirth and therefore suffering. But that is
not possible without the right conditions. In the ‘_Kūṭāgāra_’ sutta (‘The
Peaked-House Sutta’), The Buddha explains first the conditions that make it
impossible to put a complete end to suffering:[^12]

> Indeed, bhikkhus, if anyone said: ‘Without having built the lower structure of
> a peaked house, I shall erect the upper structure’, such a thing is
> impossible. So too, if anyone said:
>
> 1. ‘Without penetrating the Noble Truth of Suffering as it really is;
> 1. ‘without penetrating the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering as it
>    really is;
> 1. ‘without penetrating the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering as it
>    really is;
> 1. ‘without penetrating the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation
>    of Suffering as it really is,
>
> ‘I shall put a complete end to suffering’, such a thing is impossible.

This means that we cannot put a complete end to suffering (we cannot attain the
Third Noble Truth, Nibbāna) unless we have first fully realized the First Noble
Truth (suffering (_dukkha_)), and fully realized the Second Noble Truth (the
origin of suffering (_samudaya_)). Only then are we able to realize also the
supramundane Fourth Noble Truth, the Supramundane Noble Eightfold Path. The only
way to attain these realizations is to first practise the mundane Fourth Noble
Truth, the mundane path truth (_lokiya magga·sacca_), which is the mundane Noble
Eightfold Path, the threefold training:

1. Morality (_sīla_)
2. Concentration (_samādhi_)
3. Wisdom (_paññā_)[^13]

For bhikkhus, morality is _Pāṭimokkha_ restraint, and for laypeople, it is the
eight or five precepts. When we are established in morality, we can develop
access-concentration and absorption concentration (_appanā·samādhi_), which is
jhāna (_jhāna_), and can then proceed to develop wisdom, which is vipassanā
meditation. Vipassanā meditation is nothing other than to realize the
impermanent, suffering, and non-self nature of the Noble Truth of Suffering and
Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering. Only when we practise vipassanā well and
thoroughly, and fully realize these two Noble Truths, are we able to realize the
supramundane Fourth Noble Truth, the Noble Eightfold Path associated with
supramundane Path Truth (_Lokuttarā Magga·Sacca_): the Path (_Magga_) of
Stream-Entry (_Sot·Āpatti_), Once-Return (_Sakad·Āgāmi_), Non-Return
(_An·Āgāmi_), and Arahantship. In summary: the aim of the Fourth Noble Truth
(the Eightfold Noble Path) is to realize the Third Noble Truth (Nibbāna), which
is achieved only by fully realizing the First and Second Noble Truths (Suffering
and the Origin of Suffering).

## The first and second noble truth

But what is the First Noble Truth, the Noble Truth of Suffering? In the
‘_Dhamma·Cakka·Ppavattana_’ sutta (‘The Dhamma-Wheel Setting-in-Motion Sutta’),
the Buddha explains:[^14]

> Now this, bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of Suffering: birth is suffering;
> ageing is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; being united
> with the unloved is suffering; being separated from the loved is suffering;
> not to get what one wants is suffering: in brief, the five clinging-aggregates
> (_pañc·upādāna·kkhandhā_) are suffering.

When The Buddha teaches the Noble Truth of Suffering, He teaches the five
aggregates; He teaches us to know and see the five aggregates. Our human world
is the five-constituent existence (_pañca·vokāra·bhava_) (the world of five
aggregates), and unless we know and see the five aggregates, we cannot realize
The Buddha’s Teaching. This He explains in the ‘_Puppha_’ sutta (‘The Flower
Sutta’):[^15]

> And what is the ultimate reality of the world (_loke loka·dhammo_) that the
> Tathāgata has realized with perfect and complete knowledge?
>
> 1. Materiality (_rūpa_)…
> 1. Feeling (_vedanā_)…
> 1. Perception (_saññā_)…
> 1. Mental formations (saṅkhārā)[^16]…
> 1. Consciousness (viññāṇa),
>
> bhikkhus, is the ultimate reality of the world that the Tathāgata has realized
> with perfect and complete knowledge.
>
> Having done so, He explains it, teaches it, proclaims it, establishes it,
> discloses it and elucidates it. When it is thus explained, taught, disclosed,
> analysed and elucidated by the Tathāgata, if there is someone who does not
> know and see, how can I do anything with that foolish common person, blind and
> sightless, who does not know and does not see?

The realities of the world that The Buddha is here explaining are the five
aggregates, which are the Noble Truth of Suffering and the Noble Truth of the
Origin of Suffering. And in the ‘_Mahā·Sati·Paṭṭhāna_’ sutta (‘The Great
Mindfulness-Foundation Sutta’) He explains:17
