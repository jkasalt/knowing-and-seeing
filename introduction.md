# Introduction

## The Buddha's Dispensation

> On one occasion, the Blessed One was dwelling among Vajjians at Koṭigāma.
> There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus[^10] thus:[^11] It is, bhikkhus,
> because of not understanding (an·anubodhā) and not penetrating (a·ppaṭivedhā)
> the Four Noble Truths (Catunnaṁ Ariya·Saccānaṁ) that you and I have for a long
> time wandered the round of rebirth. What four?
>
> 1. It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and not penetrating the Noble
>    Truth of Suffering (Dukkhassa Ariya·Saccassa) that you and I have for a
>    long time wandered the round of rebirth.
> 2. It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and not penetrating the Noble
>    Truth of the Origin of Suffering (Dukkha·Samudayassa Ariya·Saccassa) that
>    you and I have for a long time wandered the round of rebirth.
> 3. It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and not penetrating the Noble
>    Truth of the Cessation of Suffering (Dukkha·Nirodhassa Ariya·Saccassa) that
>    you and I have for a long time wandered the round of rebirth.
> 4. It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and not penetrating the Noble
>    Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering
>    (Duk-kha·Nirodha·Gāminiya Paṭipadāya Ariya·Saccassa) that you and I have
>    for a long time wandered the round of rebirth.

The Four Noble Truths are thus the foundations of The Buddha’s Teaching, His
Dispensation. He then explains:

> 1. The Noble Truth of Suffering, bhikkhus, has been understood and penetrated.
> 2. The Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering has been understood and
>    pentrated.
> 3. The Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering has been understood and
>    penetrated.
> 4. The Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering has been
>    understood and penetrated. Craving for existence has been cut off; the
>    tendency to existence has been destroyed; now there is no more renewed
>    existence.
